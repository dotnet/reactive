    For .NET 6.0 and later, we need to specify the Windows 10 target framework because Windows
    Runtime APIs are not available on older platforms. We use:
    CoreDispatcher          10.0.10240
    CoreDispatcherPriority  10.0.10240
    CoreWindow              10.0.10240
    DispatcherQueue         10.0.16299
    DispatcherQueueTimer    10.0.16299

    So in theory, 10.0.16299.0 meets our needs. However, the .NET SDK doesn't recognize that.
    The oldest version it supports in a TFM is 10.0.17763.0, corresponding to Windows 1809.
    Although that went out of mainstream support in 2021, it's still in extended support until 2029
    for enterprises paying for long term support. It is also a common choice for the oldest version
    supported by tooling (e.g., the .NET SDK), which would make it a reasonable choice here.
    However, the minimum version of System.Reactive that supports Windows Runtime requires a TFM
    specifying Windows 10.0.19041 or later, and although the System.Reactive API surface area is
    essentially the same on net8.0 and net8.0-windows10.0.19041, there is a difference in behaviour:
    the net8.0-windows10.0.19041 version registers for app lifecycle events. We don't want to
    encourage people to use Windows Runtime features from this library with the non-Windows-Runtime-aware
    target of System.Reactive, so we match the Windows version in the TFM.
    For UWP we need a newer version because Visual Studio 2026 supports nothing older than 18362.

    <!-- 26100 not 18362 because the Azure DevOps hosted build agents don't offer 18362, and there appears
         not to be any official supported way to get it on there.
         We end up with a reference to Windows 255.255.255.255 in any case, so as far as I can tell, this
         produces results indistinguishable from what we would get with 18362. The only issue here is that
         in theory it makes it possible for the code to refer to an API that is not available on 18362. In
         practice, we're not doing that, and we don't expect to change this code much in the future, so it
         shouldn't happen.
