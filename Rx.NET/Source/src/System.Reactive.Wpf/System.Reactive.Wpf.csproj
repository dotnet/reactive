    WPF is available on net8.0-windows, and although this is technically shorthand for Windows 7, that's not
    widely understood. People often leave out the version number because they think it means no particular version.
    We don't want to force people to use a more complex TFM. Also, although Windows 7 is long out of support, there
    is one technical reason not to specify a later version: you end up deploying a quite large .winmd file if you
    specify one of the later versions, and if you're not actually using any WinRT APIs, this is just wasted space.

    Historically, Rx has required you to use at least windows10.0.19041 to get WPF support, but that was a side effect
    of the great unification making WPF inextricable from the target framework. Now that we have separated out the WPF
    we can make it work for simpler TFMs, because nothing actually requires us to use any WinRT APIs.
