# WPF support for Rx (Reactive Extensions for .NET)

This is part of the Reactive Extensions for .NET (Rx). Rx enables event-driven programming with a composable, declarative model. The main Rx package is `System.Reactive`, which provides the core types and operators. This package, `System.Reactive.Wpf`, provides additional support for using Rx with WPF applications.
