    We need to be on a sufficiently recent version of the test framework, because we need this fix:
      https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/pull/1071
    Without this, the test runner fails to process Windows-version-specific TFMs for .NET 6.0.
    Since the various libraries that require net6.0-windows all specify a minimum version (10.0.19041
    for reasons not currently clear to me; idg10) this test project needs to specify at least as new
    a version. If we write just net6.0-windows, that turns out to imply Windows 7.0, so it is not
    considered compatible with a net6.0-windows10.0.19041 library.
    Before that PR was merged, the test runner wouldn't work if the host specified a TFM with a
    specific Windows version.
