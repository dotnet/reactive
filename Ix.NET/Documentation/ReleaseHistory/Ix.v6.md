# Ix Release History v6.0


## v6.1.0

New functionality:

* Added `ToImmutable*Async` extension methods so `System.Linq.Async` (PR https://github.com/dotnet/reactive/pull/1545 from [Tau GÃ¤rtli](https://github.com/bash))

Bug fixes:

 * Fix [Union dispose bug](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive/issues/2112) in `System.Linq.Async`

## v6.0.1

First release with version number updated to v6.0.x. (At the time, Rx and Ix were attempting to follow a policy of keeping version numbers aligned with the .NET runtime libraries.)

Added `MinByWithTies` and `MaxByWithTies` to reinstate functionality that was lost in v5.1. (When .NET 6.0 added its own MinBy/MaxBy, Ix v5.1 removed its methods, but some of those did things the .NET 6.0 versions can't.)
