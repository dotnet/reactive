                            // 2^30, since doubling to 2^31 is 1 larger than Int32.MaxValue.  In that case, we instead

                            // cast to uint).  Because a slightly larger constant is used when T is one byte in size, we

                            // large size, each new element added after MaxArrayLength will end up doing a resize.
