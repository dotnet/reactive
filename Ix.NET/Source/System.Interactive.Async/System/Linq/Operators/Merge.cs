            //           - are renamed to ConcurrentMerge for clarity (likely alongside a ConcurrentZip).
            //         - All overloads of Merge are non-concurrent
            //           - and are simply SelectMany operator macros (maybe more optimized)
            //         - Have ConcurrentMerge next to Merge overloads
            //           - where ConcurrentMerge may need a degree of concurrency parameter (and maybe other options), and,
            //           - where the overload set of both families may be asymmetric
